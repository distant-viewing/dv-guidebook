# DVD Tutorial: Introduction

For this tutorial, we will be working through treating DVDs as data.
This approach will allow you to study the entirety of a television
series (say, the entire run of one of your favorite television shows, or
maybe multiple television shows with several seasons each), as well as
large collections of films.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

-   Understand and apply distant viewing to visual media

-   Create a new dataset of visual media from DVDs

-   Conduct a computer vision-aided study of visual style in film or
    television

-   Identify patterns using distant viewing

-   Select quantitatively significant trends between corpora

-   Investigate the cause, importance, and effects of visual data trends

This tutorial introduces the application of distant viewing to a
specific form of visual corpora: DVDs. This tutorial focuses on DVDs for
their ease of access and capacity for holding large volumes of visual
data.

## DVD Tutorial: DVDs as Data

Digital Video Discs/Digital Versatile Discs (DVD) are both a prominent
form of visual media and a prevalent source of data. DVDs are a mass
production medium seen as a successor to the compact disc (CD) due to a
higher storage capacity (about 4.7 GB on the average DVD to CDs
containing about 700 MB). Further, DVDs can store any kind of digital
data. They were used commonly from 1996 to the early 2010s for the
circulation of television, film, and other visual media. DVDs have been
succeeded slowly by Blu-Rays since the late 2000s due to the newer
medium's even higher storage capacity and higher resolution video files.
Yet, DVDs are still commonly used as of the early 2020s, particularly
with DVD box sets for entire television series and single films or film
collections in collected DVD cases.

The challenge to distant viewing, then, is that we need to get the
digital file from the physical DVD with specific kinds of formatting
protections to a computer. Further complicating this is that the digital
file needs to be in certain formats, such as .mp4, in order to be
amenable to distant viewing. Overcoming this challenge requires a
conversion process of ripping data from DVDs, converting that data into
a format we can work with, and then actually loading that now-usable
data into the Distant Viewing Toolkit.

## DVD Tutorial: Preparation

### DVD Tutorial Preparation: Suggested Prior Skills

For the first stage of the tutorial, the DVD Ripping, no programming
experience is needed. That said, you will need access to a DVD drive for
ripping DVD data (more on this in the following section).

This tutorial operates under the assumption that you have at least one
collection of DVDs from a singular television show, preferably a
complete series. If you have more, so much the better! Much of this
tutorial can also be applied to films and DVDs with singular video files
included.

We focus here on DVDs over Blu-Rays or other video file formats due to
the preponderance of DVDs and as Blu-Rays require different kinds of
encoding and decoding.

For the second stage of the tutorial, familiarity with the theoretical
framework and rationale of [[distant
viewing]{.underline}](https://www.distantviewing.org/) will be important
for working through this tutorial. We specifically suggest reading the
following published case study on how distant viewing has previously
been applied to [[two North American network-era television
sitcoms]{.underline}](https://statsmaths.github.io/pdf/2019-visual-style.pdf).

Additionally for the second stage, we assume familiarity with some data
analysis-oriented programming languages, particularly Python and R. If
you are unfamiliar with applying such skillsets to visual media, we
recommend the tutorial on [[R Basics with Tabular
Data]{.underline}](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/r-basics-with-tabular-data)
and the [[Computer Vision For The
Humanities]{.underline}](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/computer-vision-deep-learning-pt1)
training modules.

### DVD Tutorial Preparation: Installation and Setup

To begin, you will need two primary elements: DVD ripping hardware in
the form of a DVD-RW drive for interacting with the physical DVD, and
software to convert video files housed on the physical DVD. These are
slightly unique elements related to **ripping DVDs**, a process of
extracting data from a CD, DVD, or other physical media.

### DVD Tutorial Preparation: DVD Ripping Hardware

![](media/image5.png){width="6.5in" height="3.6666666666666665in"}

Figure xx: An image of an internal DVD drive. Note the "RW" designator
on the casing itself, able to read "ReWriteable" discs. External DVD
drives are often slimmer and connected by USB or similar cables.

Not all DVD drives are capable of ripping DVDs; most are capable of
playing DVDs, but what we need for this tutorial is a **DVD-RW** (or,
ReWriteable) drive. Therefore, if your primary computer does have an
internal DVD drive, you will need to look up the model or the type to
ensure it can rip DVDs.

If you do not have a DVD drive, you can purchase an external DVD drive
to plug into a computer. These are typically powered by a simple USB
plug or similarly common connector cord.

DVD drives can be purchased online with different price points depending
on how fast you want to rip DVDs at, and whether you want to rip more
expensive or higher-quality media (such as Blu-Rays and 4K Ultra High
Definition discs). While we strongly recommend doing your own research
and examining what works best within your budget for your intended
project, this review article has a solid overview of options:

### DVD Tutorial Preparation: DVD Ripping Software

Our primary DVD ripping and encoding program will be
[[HandBrake]{.underline}](https://handbrake.fr/), which is an open
source and free video transcoder available on multiple platforms. You
will need to install HandBrake before proceeding to the next stage of
this tutorial.

![](media/image3.png){width="6.5in" height="4.416666666666667in"}

Figure xx: An image of the HandBrake user interface and home screen.
HandBrake is a popular visual media encoder that is popularly used for
ripping and compressing data from DVDs and other physical visual media.

HandBrake has several [[download
options]{.underline}](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) and extensive
[[documentation]{.underline}](https://handbrake.fr/docs/), which can be
found at: [[https://handbrake.fr/]{.underline}](https://handbrake.fr/).
From their documentation, "HandBrake takes videos you already have and
makes new ones that work on your mobile phone, tablet, TV media player,
game console, computer, or web browser---nearly anything that supports
modern video formats." We recommend HandBrake due to its open-source
nature; its extensive capabilities; its vibrant and active community;
and its ubiquity across different platforms.

## DVD Tutorial Preparation: DVD Dataset Preparation

In order to use HandBrake for copyright-protected DVDs, some operating
systems may need a separate plugin that will help decrypt these
protections. Without such plugins or external files paired with programs
like Handbrake, your ripped files will turn out fragmented, pixelated,
and distorted: copyright measures in action.

For instance, Windows needs a file called "libdvdcss-2.dll" installed
into the Handbrake Installation folder. In the United States, DVDs are
able to be ripped for academic purposes. Before proceeding further,
please check up on the copyright laws in your location, and if
necessary, reach out to specialists with knowledge in this area. [**To
comply with US copyright laws, we have undertaken the following measures
with our own sample dataset:**]{.mark}

-   

Keep all of your DVDs physically organized and clearly labeled. Keep or
compile a list of what episodes are on each disc, and keep a list of how
many episodes are in each season/series.

Have your naming convention set before you begin ripping. This is key
for saving time now and later, as well as for organizational purposes
when you have moved to the research and analysis stages.

![](media/image1.png){width="3.96875in" height="0.65625in"}

Figure xx: Visual example of our recommended naming convention in
Handbrake.

If working with a series, we recommend a format similar to this:

-   seriestitle_s##\_e##.mp4

-   ex: freshprince_01_e01.mp4

If working with a single film or movie, we recommend something like:

-   movietitle_releaseyear.mp4

-   frankenstein_1931.mp4

This format serves several functions:

-   Clear organization for you and fellow researchers (present and
    future)

-   Streamlined naming process for batch ripping

-   Appending the .mp4 file extension in the name ensures the file
    format will be read correctly on export

HandBrake offers options for [[automatic file
naming]{.underline}](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.0.0/technical/automatic-file-naming.html).
However, we recommend manually setting the file names in the following
"Ripping DVDs with HandBrake" section for quality control purposes.

## DVD Tutorial Preparation: Sample Dataset 

Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton previously published a case study of two
such North American television series, so we will be referring to those
as examples for the purposes of this study. These are *I Dream of
Jeannie* (1965-1970) and *Bewitched* (1964-1972). We also will refer to
a singular New Hollywood-era film in the dataset, *Taxi Driver* (1976),
directed by Martin Scorsese.

Distant viewing allows you to study not just every scene from a single
television show at the same time, but every frame of every scene of
every episode. It also allows for cross-corpora comparisons and
analysis: seasons one and two of *I Dream of Jeannie* alongside seasons
three, four, and five from *Bewitched*, or as another example, each of
the holiday episodes from each series.

## DVD Tutorial: Ripping DVDs with HandBrake

![](media/image4.png){width="6.5in" height="5.791666666666667in"}

Figure xx: The Handbrake user interface. Highlighted are three key areas
to be used frequently in this tutorial: Open Source for loading video
sources (DVDs); Preset for video format presets; and Subtitle for
selecting caption options.

The overall sequence for Handbrake will follow this loop:

-   Set up your data (DVD)

-   Load DVD and select it as your source

-   Choose the first video file

-   Choose the associated subtitle file

-   Name it

-   Add it to Queue

-   Rip the Queue

-   Load the next DVD and repeat

HandBrake is a powerful and robust software tool, so the rest of this
tutorial section will walk you through choosing the right selections for
your project.

## DVD Tutorial: HandBrake, Format Preset

HandBrake has many video formatting options and capabilities. Each
format option may be more or less suited for your individual video file
and for your dataset.

We recommend Fast 1080p30. This is a [[standard preset for
HandBrake]{.underline}](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/1.0.0/technical/official-presets.html)
and is well-suited for a variety of DVDs due to its speed of ripping
(Fast) and its video quality (1080p, 30fps), but this will be determined
somewhat by your computer's processing capabilities and your physical
DVD drive's capabilities. You can always set up specific DVD ripping
format presets for each project or as needed.

This preset allows for the burning of video quality \*up to\* 1080p and
30 frames per second. Most DVDs, however, will be ripped at a lower
resolution of 720p due to the hard limitations of the physical
technology of the DVD itself. This means that the video files, while
being ripped with a Handbrake preset of 1080p, will actually be
formatted to a 720x480 pixel resolution, by and large.

Blu-Ray discs are capable of holding much higher-quality video files,
and therefore, can be ripped at much higher quality; this will end up
taking more time should a higher resolution or preset be selected.
However, as is noted in the HandBrake program documentation, Blu-Rays
are primarily unable to be collected with HandBrake due to their unique
encoding traits as of 2023. **[Other programs such as
EaseFabLossLessCopy and MakeMKV can be used to collect Blu-Rays, which
will be covered \[\[later in a separate tutorial\]\].]{.underline}**

Likewise, there are more advanced and nuanced visual quality options
within Handbrake; for our purposes, we primarily recommend the 1080p,
30fps Fast option due to its default setting and as it will be able to
accommodate the vast majority of DVD sets, both for classic visual media
and contemporary visual media.

We recommend experimenting with these presets, and creating your own
preset that suits your project's needs with respect to visual data
collection, caption collection, and naming conventions. This process
ensures standardization of your DVD ripping practices along with

## DVD Tutorial: HandBrake, Pre-Rip

This first stage involves loading the DVD into HandBrake itself.

1.  Open Handbrake

2.  Load the first DVD into your DVD drive.

3.  Select "Source"

4.  Select the DVD to be ripped.

Once you have selected your source, HandBrake will load in all of the
video and textual files it can detect from the DVD itself. These files
will be temporarily hosted within HandBrake; note that nothing has been
ripped yet.

Before proceeding to the Ripping stage, compare the content of the DVD
and its organization with a trusted source of film/television
metadata/information. First, make sure that the DVD's contents are as
advertised in the case. Secondly, for television shows or DVDs with
multiple films or larger files on them, ensure that the episodes are in
release order. We particularly recommend IMDB as a cross-referencing
tool. We highlight this crucial stage as most, but not all, DVDs work to
present television shows in something akin to chronological order.

If your DVD is ordered correctly or organized as expected, proceed to
the "Handbrake, Ripping" section below. If your DVD is organized
incorrectly, or to learn more about why DVD organization and user
verification is so crucial, please continue on.

## DVD Tutorial: HandBrake, Pre-Rip

![](media/image6.png){width="6.5in" height="1.8055555555555556in"}

Figure xx: A comparison of Handbrake reading the *Sanford and Son* DVD
box set, the episodes housed on *Sanford and Son* Season 6 Disc 1, and
the chronological release order of *Sanford and Son* Season 6 taken from
IMDB.com. Note the differences particularly between episodes 1 and 2
each of the DVD and IMDB, and how this affects file naming.

Not all DVDs are constructed in the same way: for instance, the complete
box set of *Sanford and Son* (1972-1977) features 136 episodes across 17
discs, so it contains every episode from the show. However,
[[consumers]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VUIRHI315HT4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DSNEME)
have noted that these episodes are presented in the box set out of
release order, in every season's DVDs. Because this television show is
included in our dataset, we verified this issue.

Figure xx helps visualize this issue and its import. If one were to rip
the *Sanford and Son* DVDs as-is, then our files would be ordered
incorrectly: pulling from Disc 1 of Season 6, our first file labeled as
season 6, episode 1 (s06_e01) is chronologically season 6, episode 9,
titled "Fred\'s Extra Job," wherein Fred Sanford gets an additional job
working as a bus boy to pay back a bank loan. Likewise, the second file
on the disc, what might be labeled be season 6, episode 2 (s06_e02)
without cross-referencing, is actually season 6, episode 6: "I Dream of
Choo Choo Rabinowitz." [[Amazon user
DTCG]{.underline}](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6GNEP7OHHI7K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DSNEME)
has a more thorough accounting of the misordered episodes in this DVD
box set, with a few highlights presented here:

> [Season 1 is in order.]{.mark}
>
> [Season 2 starts with Episode 14]{.mark}
>
> [Season 3 starts with Episode 6]{.mark}
>
> [Season 4 Starts with Episode 11 and episode 24 is actually on Disc 1
> of Season 5]{.mark}
>
> [Season 5\.... they managed to get the correct episodes and order, but
> Episode 24 of Season 4 is on Disc 1]{.mark}
>
> [Season 6 is Close\... but no cigar (2018)]{.mark}

This distinction might feel small, pedantic even, when considering the
study of entire television shows all at once. But, treating these DVDs
as data requires keeping our data tidy, organized, and ordered, because
the alternative is incorrect data. To return to our recent example, of
*Sanford and Son* file s06_01 actually being season 6, episode 9: if we
noticed something unique visually about this episode, and wrote about it
or taught this episode, the findings would be suspect, faulty even. We
would be calling attention to findings in a mid-season episode, when
others might be thinking our findings are related to the *actual* season
6 opener, a three-part episode where both Fred and Lamont Sanford go to
Hawaii. Moreover, this incorrect ordering can cause a cascading effect
on the rest of our DVD data: if one episode is out of order, then at
least one other episode is out of order, and more than likely, multiple
episodes are incorrectly organized. For instance: Figure xx shows that
the season 6 openers are, likewise, incorrectly ordered on the DVD as
episodes 3 and 4 of Season 6. Not only do we have to rectify "Fred's
Extra Job," "I Dream of Choo Choo Rabinowitz," and the three-part
"Hawaii" episodes, but we also have to rectify the episodes that each of
those were taking the place of, and so on.

These issues can be fixed after the Ripping stage is complete. All that
would be needed is a simple renaming and reorganizing of files. But, as
with our earlier stages of data collection, being diligent throughout
the entire process saves headaches now and in the future, for yourself
and for collaborators, as well as for potential users of your dataset,
should you wish to turn it public or share it with others.

When you have a handle on how your DVD is organized and are ready,
proceed to the "Handbrake, Ripping" section.

## DVD Tutorial: Handbrake, Ripping

Each DVD consists of several video files, each of varying sizes and
lengths. It will be up to you to determine which video files are worth
ripping for this project, and which are not.

Many DVDs will have small, two-to-thirty second video files that pertain
to the DVD menus. These can be filtered out as needed in HandBrake:
Tools \> Preferences \> Advanced \> Advanced Options \> "Minimum DVD and
Blu-Ray title duration in sections."

For television DVDs, each episode will be contained in its own video
file. For movie DVDs, there should be one large file consisting of the
actual movie itself. Many DVDs will typically have a "Play All" file,
which is roughly the same size as the rest of the files combined, in
addition to individual episode files. Occasionally, HandBrake will
detect multiple video files for the same television episode: this may be
due to director's cuts, to commentary episodes, or simply to one having
a scene that was removed/added after the fact.

![](media/image2.png){width="3.2916666666666665in"
height="2.1666666666666665in"}

\[\[Figure xx: Handbrake is adept at finding all video files within a
DVD disc, including small files primarily used for DVD menus and large
"Play All" video files. Highlighted is one of the movies on a DVD that
we would want, with the other two being the files over one hour
long.\]\]

We recommend the following choices in choosing video files from each
DVD:

-   Ignore the much larger "Play All" video file.

-   Ignore or filter out the much smaller two-to-thirty second video
    files.

-   Choose the file with more "chapter breaks" when faced with two video
    files for the same episode.

-   Review the video file after ripping to confirm that your choices
    were correct, and that this particular video file will work for your
    data analysis.

    -   Particularly review it using the "Pre-Rip" tutorial.

Once you have chosen your first video file to rip:

-   Go to "Subtitles," select the file you want, and add that Subtitle
    track (if present).

-   Choose between Default, Burn In, and Foreign Scan presentation
    options

    -   We recommend selecting Default, or simply adding in the track
        and leaving all options off.

    -   This will ensure that the captions are not automatically burned
        in to your video file itself, which may disrupt or negatively
        impact your visual analysis.

-   Copy/paste your naming convention in. This allows you to quickly
    modify the episode title.

    -   C:\\Users\\XXXX\\Videos\\DVD NAME IN IMPROPER NAMING CONVENTION

    -   C:\\Users\\XXXX\\Videos\\ seriestitle_s##\_e##.mp4

    -   While naming conventions can be selected manually through
        HandBrake's preferences tab, we strongly recommend copying and
        pasting your naming convention in. This will allow maximum
        quality control.

-   Select "Add to Queue"

-   Repeat the process for the additional video files you will be
    ripping from this DVD.

-   Select the Queue preview to actually see the settings for each file
    once all of your chosen video files are added to the Queue.

-   Review each file to ensure that the options are expected; treat this
    as a quality control step.

-   Click the "Encode" button. Your computer will begin ripping the DVD
    files to your specified location.

When you have completely ripped your first DVD, repeat these steps
through the rest of the DVDs in this selection. When all of the DVDs in
this group are complete, we recommend moving them to a separate,
self-contained folder with the same naming conventions that you
previously used.

## DVD Tutorial: DV, Resolution, and PAR/SAR/DAR

Users working with the Python package of the Distant Viewing Toolkit may
discover that the DVD video files' resolution does not match the still
images generated with ffprobe. DVDs are always in either NTSC or PAL
format. NTSC format is most common in the U.S., South America, and in
Japan, primarily corresponding to a resolution of 720x480. PAL format is
most common in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and some parts of South
America. Many DVDs are capable of playing at slightly different aspect
ratios (say, 1.5 for Standard Definition compared to High Definition at
16/9 or 1.7778).

This is due to a combination of three elements that are often overlooked
or not immediately apparent when watching video files normally: Pixel
Aspect Ratio (PAR), Sampled Aspect Ratio (SAR), and Display Aspect Ratio
(DAR).

The first is what is fixed by the video file's format (it's around
720x480 for most common DVDs). The third can be specified in the file to
indicate that the image needs to be stretched when played. The SAR is
just the ratio between the two. The video files for one popular sitcom,
*Parks and Recreation* for instance*,* have a PAR of 720x479, a SAR of
32:27, and a DAR of 1280:717.

[Playing a file on a common media player like VLC automatically
stretches the image to match the DAR, but the data quality is fixed by
the PAR. But, most computer libraries (including the OpenCV, a common
open source computer library) read the digital images according to the
PAR and are therefore incorrectly stretching the image, or the frame
being pulled: instead of reading the digital images at 720x480, the
frame might be read at 857x431, a significant distortion. This matters
for data stability and analysis: if the aspects and resolution are not
fixed in all points of study, then both the algorithms' scanning of the
moving images and the human interpretations/analyses will be
incorrect.]{.mark}

### HandBrake Solution

[However, there is one solution in Handbrake: in the "Dimensions" tab,
users can change the Pixel Aspect ratio, along with the Scaled Size, and
can even allow for Upscaling a video file artificially. HandBrake
defaults to, well, the video file's default or automatic resolution
settings, including its Pixel Aspect Ratio. This will most likely be
close to, but not quite, 1:1 due to the DVD's formatting as above. You
can modify it here to a custom setting either by changing the Anamorphic
setting from Automatic to Custom, or, you can deselect "Optimal Size"
and modify the video file from there.]{.mark}

### ffmpeg solution

[The more technical option is that you can use use]{.mark}
[[[ffmpeg]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://ffmpeg.org/) [to automatically
re-sample the video file so that PAR = DAR, with a SAR of 1. This will
ensure that the aspect ratios stay stable across all points of contact,
particularly the back-end when using Python. This is our preferred
method of modifying this.]{.mark}

## DVD Tutorial: Next Steps

In this tutorial, you learned about:

-   A popular moving image collection tool called HandBrake

-   Collecting moving image files from DVDs

-   Organizing moving image files in an orderly, efficient fashion

This tutorial primarily focused on helping you understand DVDs as data,
making informed decisions about when and how to collect moving image
files, and how to prepare DVDs as data for your own work.

The practical section of this tutorial will prepare you for:

-   Applying annotators to your moving image files

-   Exploring and analyzing the data that you generate from moving
    images
